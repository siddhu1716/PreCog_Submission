For the given task, We have used pretrained model ( Fast R-CNN with a backbone of ResNet50 ) used for object detection

The Model is previously trained on Pascal VOC dataset 

which contains the following classes:
```notepad
background
aeroplane
bicycle
bird
boat
bottle
bus
car
cat
chair
cow
diningtable
dog
horse
motorbike
person
pottedplant
sheep
sofa
train
tvmonitor
```

Using that model we have calclulated the frequency of the detected objects

and represented as follows
